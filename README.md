This is a fan made remake of the original game created by Burkhard Ratheiser who deserves a lot of credit for making a great platformer I enjoyed as a kid.
All fan recreations on my Git Hub  exist only for me to practice and try out different ays to make games.
The assets in the project are made by me to mimic the art style of the original game. This is because I use recreating the art in my own way to practice making
pixel art, audio for music/sound effects, and animations.

##Tools used
Game Engine: [Unity](https://unity.com/)
Pixel Art: [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/)
